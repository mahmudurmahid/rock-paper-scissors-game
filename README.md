# Cosmic Clash 

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#bully-book-club-website)

Cosmic Clash is an interactive static website which allows a user to play the game rock, paper, scissors against the computer opponent. We added additional fetaures such as a space theme with the moves such as lizard and spock for a fun variation of the tradional game.  

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional [shields.io](https://shields.io) badges to your README, I like to add them to this section.

## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

First time and returning user stories: 

As a user, I want the game to correctly determine the winner based on RPSLS rules so that I can see who wins each round.

As a user, I want a limited number of tries in a game so that the game feels challenging and finite.

As a user, I want my scores to be tracked during the game so that I can see how well I perform in a session.

As a user, I want to play against a computer opponent so that I have a challenging and interactive experience.

As a user, I want clear instructions on how to play so that I can understand the rules and enjoy the game.

As a user, I want a reset button so that I can start the game over at any time.

As a user, I want a clear end-game message so that I know when the game is over.

## Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile and desktop using Balsamiq.

### Colour Scheme

Add all information about your colour scheme for your site here. You can explain why you choose the colours you did?

I like to include a palette of the colour scheme here, my favourite site for creating a colour palette is [coolors](https://coolors.co/), but there are lots of other sites that also do the same thing, like [ColorSpace](https://mycolor.space/?hex=%23F5F5F5&sub=1), [Muzli Colors](https://colors.muz.li/), [Adobe Colour Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) to name a few.

### Typography

If you've imported fonts to use in your project, add some information about them here. You can include information like:

Why did you choose the font you have?
Is this an accessibly friendly font?
What weights have you included?

I also like to include an image of the fonts chosen as a reference.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) is a popular choice for importing fonts to use in your project, as it doesn't require you to download the fonts to use them.

### Imagery

Use this section to explain what sort of imagery you plan to use through your site.

## Features

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed user experience section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms#Features)

This section can be used to explain what pages your site is made up of.

### General features on each page

If there is a feature that appears on all pages of your site, include it here. Examples of what to include would the the navigation, a footer and a favicon.

I then like to add a screenshot of each page of the site here, i use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) which allows me to grab an image of the site as it would be displayed on mobile, tablet and desktop, this helps to show the responsiveness of the site.

### Future Implementations

What features would you like to implement in the future on your site? Would you like to add more pages, or create login functionality? Add these plans here.

### Accessibility

Be an amazing developer and get used to thinking about accessibility in all of your projects!

This is the place to make a note of anything you have done with accessibility in mind. Some examples include:

Have you used icons and added aria-labels to enable screen readers to understand these?
Have you ensured your site meets the minimum contrast requirements?
Have you chosen fonts that are dyslexia/accessible friendly?

Code Institute have an amazing channel for all things accessibility (a11y-accessibility) I would highly recommend joining this channel as it contains a wealth of information about accessibility and what we can do as developers to be more inclusive.

## Technologies Used

üë©üèª‚Äçüíª View an example of a completed Technologies Used section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Bully-Book-Club#Technologies-Used)

### Languages Used

HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

### Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

Add any frameworks, libraries or programs used while creating your project.

Make sure to include things like git, GitHub, the program used to make your wireframes, any programs used to compress your images, did you use a CSS framework like Bootstrap? If so add it here (add the version used).

A great tip for this section is to include them as you use them, that way you won't forget what you ended up using when you get to the end of your project.

Balsamiq - Used to create wireframes.

Github - To save and store the files for the website.

Google Fonts - To import the fonts used on the website.

Font Awesome - For the iconography on the website.

Google Dev Tools - To troubleshoot and test features, solve issues with responsiveness and styling.

Favicon.io To create favicon.

### AI

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

We utilised Github Pages to deploy the game site. Please find a guide on how to do so below:

1. Log in to Github.
2. Find the repository called Rock-paper-scissors-game.
3. Click on the settings icon.
4. On the left hand side in the navigation page, find the Pages link.
5. In the  Branch section of Build and Deploy, make sure to choose main from the drop down menu. then select Root in the folder drop menu.
6. Click Save. The site is now live and can be accessed via the URL. This can also be found on the repository homepage.

### Local Development

#### How to Fork

To fork the repository:

1. Log in to Github.
2. Find the Rock-paper-scissors-game repository.
3. Find the fork button in the top right hand corner.

#### How to Clone

To clone the Rock-paper-scissors-game repository:

1. Log in to Github.
2. Find the Rock-paper-scissors-game repository.
3. Click on the code button, in the clone section select the option you desire to clone the project with. Then copy the URL.
4. Open the terminal in your code editor and change the current working directory to the location you want to use for the cloned directory.
5. Type 'git clone' into the terminal and then paste the link you copied in step 3. Press enter.

## Testing

Start as you mean to go on - and get used to writing a TESTING.md file from the very first project!

Testing requirements aren't massive for your first project, however if you start using a TESTING.md file from your first project you will thank yourself later when completing your later projects, which will contain much more information.
  
Use this part of the README to link to your TESTING.md file - you can view the example TESTING.md file [here](milestone1-testing.md)

## Credits

### Code Used

If you have used some code in your project that you didn't write, this is the place to make note of it. Credit the author of the code and if possible a link to where you found the code. You could also add in a brief description of what the code does, or what you are using it for here.

### Content

Who wrote the content for the website? Was it yourself - or have you made the site for someone and they specified what the site was to say? This is the best place to put this information.
